# Predicting-cardiac-events-in-patients

* The study aims to determine the utility of Dobutamine Stress Echocardiography (DSE) to efficiently predict a patientâ€™s risk of having a cardiac event in the year after testing. 

* Dobutamine, a sympathomimetic drug, is used to induce stress for useful clinical analysis.

* Data: http://www.stat.ucla.edu/projects/datasets/cardiac-explanation.html

* The script is a predictive model based on decision trees to determine if the patient is likely to have one of the four events namely:

(1) myocardial infarction (MI)

(2) revascularization by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)

(3) coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) 

(4) cardiac death

* Graphviz is used to plot the trees
